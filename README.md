This speaks of a life that shines amid the paradox of new beginnings and endings at every moment.

Life is like a meter. The moment we are born, a sealed valve is released, and the numbers begin to riseâ€”quietly yet steadily, one by one. These numbers are not merely measures of time; they are the traces of our journey, the evidence of our experiences, our joys, and our sorrows.

The soaring numbers symbolize the unforeseen uncertainty of the future. In the relentless flow of time, I embrace the knowledge that my existence is etched into these ever-increasing digits, not knowing when it will cease. Amid the numbers racing toward their final destination, I dream of the meaning of existence and the endless possibilities it holds.
